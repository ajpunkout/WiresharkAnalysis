# WiresharkAnalysis
This is a Wireshark report for a excercise in my coursework. In this exercise Anne's computer was communicatig  with a threat actor and even sent over a file from the companies internal database. The goal is to determine who Anne was speaking to and any other relavant information on the attacker and the file sent.
